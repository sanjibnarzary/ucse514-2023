    Tulips (Tulipa) are a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous
     bulbiferous geophytes (having bulbs as storage organs). The flowers 
     are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, 
     orange, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). They often 
     have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and 
     sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability
      within the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification
     has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily 
    family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely 
    related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.
